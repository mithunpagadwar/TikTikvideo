# TikTik Platform - Setup Guide

## Quick Start

Your TikTik video platform is now running on port 5000! All the code is ready, but you need to configure your environment variables for production features to work.

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

1. **Live Streaming** - Now uses MediaRecorder API to actually record streams and upload to Cloudflare R2
2. **Short Videos** - Play immediately and persist in feed (already working correctly)
3. **User Isolation** - My Channel only shows videos uploaded by the current user
4. **All Backend APIs** - 4 serverless endpoints created with proper authentication
5. **Video Uploads** - Direct upload to Cloudflare R2 using pre-signed URLs (15-min expiry)
6. **Payment System** - Stripe integration for tips and payouts (ready when configured)

## 🔑 Required Setup (For Production Features)

### 1. Firebase Setup

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or use existing
3. Enable Authentication > Sign-in method > Google
4. Go to Project Settings > Service Accounts
5. Click "Generate New Private Key"
6. Add to Replit Secrets:
   - `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` = your-project-id
   - `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` = firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   - `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

### 2. Cloudflare R2 Setup

1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Navigate to R2 Object Storage
3. Create a new bucket named `tiktik-videos`
4. Go to "Manage R2 API Tokens" > Create API Token
5. Add to Replit Secrets:
   - `R2_ENDPOINT` = https://your-account-id.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
   - `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` = your-access-key
   - `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` = your-secret-key
   - `R2_BUCKET_NAME` = tiktik-videos

### 3. Stripe Setup (Optional - for payments)

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. Get your API keys from Developers > API Keys
3. Add to Replit Secrets:
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = sk_test_xxxxx or sk_live_xxxxx

### 4. CORS Configuration

Add to Replit Secrets:
- `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` = https://your-replit-url.replit.app

Or for local development:
- `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` = http://localhost:5000

## 📦 Deploy to Vercel (Production)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel

# Add environment variables in Vercel Dashboard
# Then deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## 🧪 Testing Features

### Without Environment Variables (Current State)
- ✅ UI works perfectly
- ✅ Navigation and themes
- ✅ Video player interface
- ✅ Channel pages
- ❌ Google login (needs Firebase config)
- ❌ Video uploads (needs R2 config)
- ❌ Payments (needs Stripe config)

### With Environment Variables
- ✅ Full Google authentication

- ✅ Short video uploads
- ✅ Regular video uploads
- ✅ Tip system
- ✅ Creator payouts
- ✅ Full user isolation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Videos not uploading?
- Check that R2 credentials are set in Secrets
- Verify bucket name is correct
- Check browser console for errors

### Can't log in with Google?
- Add Firebase credentials to Secrets
- Enable Google sign-in in Firebase Console
- Add authorized domain in Firebase settings

### Payments not working?
- Add Stripe secret key to Secrets
- Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242

## 📝 Firebase Security Rules

The `firestore.rules` file is already created. Deploy it:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Add Secrets** - Configure Firebase, R2, and Stripe in Replit Secrets
2. **Test Upload** - Try uploading a video after adding credentials
3. **Test Live Stream** - Record a short live stream (5 min auto-stop for demo)
4. **Deploy** - Use Vercel for production deployment
5. **Customize** - Update branding, add more categories, etc.

## 💡 Tips

- **Live streams** record for 5 minutes in the current setup (change `streamDuration` in script.js for longer)
- **File size limit** is currently 10MB for compatibility (increase in `handleVideoFileSelect`)
- **User isolation** works correctly - each user only sees their videos in "My Channel"
- **Main feed** shows all public videos from all users
- **Videos persist** after upload - they don't disappear!

## 🆘 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Check workflow logs in Replit
4. Ensure Firebase/R2/Stripe accounts are active
